# **COLLAB
### Collab was created out of the necessity to bridge the gap between volunteers and organizations. In today's fast-paced world, people often struggle to find time to volunteer or don't know where to begin. At the same time, many organizations are in need of volunteers but struggle to find them.
### Our team recognized this problem and decided to create a solution that would make it easier for both parties to connect. Collab is the result of our efforts to bring people together and make a positive impact on society.
